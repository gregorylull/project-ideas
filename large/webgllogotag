Cross platform webgl + 3d tag game, where the course is the hack reactor logo. Phones get bindings that let them use tilt control. Computers get a 3d tilting platform A la Super MonkeyBall.

Hack Reactants go in, a reaction happens, and magic happens.

I do not care about doing this, I just would like it to exist so that I can show people.
