Nicholas:

I’m unbelievably lucky to be able to do Hack Reactor with all of you. I am broke, I have no credit, and my family was unable and sometimes unwilling to help me do this program. Also, since I had only attended community college before coming to Hack Reactor, I couldn’t use anything like Upstart.

The closest internet thing available was GoFundMe, which is basically internet begging. And you lose 5% of what you get.

Luckily, I lived in the area and was able to literally pitch myself to Hack Reactor community members and alumni, who then loaned or donated money to help me come here. (As an aside, I mostly borrowed to be able to even come to San Francisco to meet with individuals to pitch.)

I’m very grateful, and I want to make it possible for individuals all over the globe to do the same.

Note: I started pitching AFTER I had already gotten in. It’s not going to make it so that ‘rabble’ get in (ugh how much I hate to imply that some individuals are rabble), it’s going to help people like me be able to come here and work alongside people like you.

There’s two pieces to this: helping individuals figure out how much money they really need, and finding alums who connect with these individuals and are capable of helping.

Third piece, the glue between those two, is figuring out how to stagger the loans and such so that it is possible for the individual to pay everyone back.
