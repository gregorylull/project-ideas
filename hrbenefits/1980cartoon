A man pulling a wheeled cart is struggling through and ancient traderoute, his wooden wheels biting into the old and deep grooves, following the winding pass around the mountain.

He gets stuck behind a fallen tree and sits to contemplate his misfortune, trying to get past the literal roadblock. He envisions replacing the winding path with a winding cobblestone path, and maybe having a mule to pull his cart for him.

Marcus and Phillip come out of nowhere and start talking to him, distracting him, as a flurry of activity happens behind the group.

While he isn’t paying attention, a mob of Hack Reactor community members arrive. His cart is replaced with an automobile. The road is paved and turned into a freeway. The freeway cuts through directly to his destination.

The man finishes his lessons with Marcus and Phillip, and turns around to once again see his misfortune, but with a handful of new ideas on how to deal with it.

WHat a surprise he encounters.

And, curious as he, he inspects the road, then climbs in the car and turns the keys.

And as he motors on down, he’s dreaming of a new, 4 lane freeway. 

And he dreams up how to build one himself.

-I totes can’t draw this up.
